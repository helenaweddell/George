For data!

To install the pandas package you need, type the following commands into your terminal:

```python -m venv .venv```
```.venv\Scripts\activate```

Then press Ctrl + Shift + P
Python: Select Interpreter then choose the one from .venv

Then type into your terminal:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

I would also use the extensions browser on the left tab to install DataWrangler, and add a breakpoint to line 39, then run in Python debug mode so that you can see what transformation is happening at each stage.
